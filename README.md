# Sarcasm-Detector - HLT Project 2020/2021 ðŸŽ“

---
The project aims to detect sarcasm in news headlines provided by the ["News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07414). 
Some data understanding techniques are applied for cleaning the dataset consequently. Later, different types of vectorization are analyzed, both semantics-based and non-semantics-based. Finally, both Neural Network-based models and non Neural Network-based models are tested on them.
